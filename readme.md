## 🌐 Installation 

### Docker

You can use all MCP servers through Docker using the cyprox/mcp-for-security Docker image. It can also be used from any MCP client with Docker support, such as the Cyprox platform.
Visit [Cyprox](https://cyprox.io) for more information.

### Manuel
Since each MCP server may require different dependencies, the `start.sh` bash script provides a general setup mechanism. Nonetheless, users should always refer to the installation instructions specific to the corresponding MCP server to ensure proper setup.
